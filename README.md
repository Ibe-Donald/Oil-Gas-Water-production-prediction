# Oil-Gas-Water-production-prediction

Challenging objectives
---

To develop a machine learning model to predict oil, gas, and water production based on historical records.

By analyzing past production data and associated parameters, and applying the standard machine learning (ML) workflow to accurately forecast production profile of the oil, gas, and water.

Key Components
---

â€¢ Historical Production Data:  Dataset containing historical production records, including production rates, choke sizes, and tubing head pressure measurements, average well head pressure, average tubing pressure, annulus pressure, downhole pressure and downhole temperature(kelvin)
